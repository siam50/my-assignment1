            <p>There are many ways to push for much-needed reforms: One way is to make a donation. <br> It doesn't
                matter
                much whether you contribute publicly or in a private <br> way - either way is good. What matters is your
                true
                intention.</p>

                long
                you live, you are important because of how effective you live.</p>
